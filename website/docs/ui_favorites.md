Favorites is a hierarchical structure of folders and words in them.

You could create folders manually via context menu.

By default the ⭐icon on the toolbar will add/remove word from the top most level.

To add/remove word from a specific folder, you can "active" a folder via context menu,
then clicking the ⭐icon will add/remove words from this folder.

Group can be associated with specific folders.
When switching groups, the associated folder will be automatically activated.

The entries can be moved simply by dragging and dropping. The entries can be deleted via context menu or by pressing the "Del" key.

In addition to adding and removing items to/from the Favorites you can perform the following operations via context menu or the main menu:

* "Export" - the Favorites contents will be exported to the specified XML file while preserving the entire structure.
* "Export to plain list" - all headwords stored in the Favorites will be saved to the specified text file as plain list without saving the folder structure.* * "Import" - the current contents of the Favorites will be replaced by the contents of the specified XML file.
